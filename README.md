## Abstract
At Indix, all systems deal with huge volumes of data, which means, they need to be distributed. We started out with using open source distributed systems (like Hadoop, HBase, Solr, Spark, etc) to help accomplish some of our needs. Along the way, we’ve also had some problems where existing solutions wouldn’t really work for the use cases that we had or there was a large operation overheard associated with them. This pushed us to build a couple of “simple” distributed systems.We built most of these using RocksDB as the backend store. This talk contains learnings from our discussion.
